I am currently working as an assistant professor of Data Analytics at the Marketing, Innovation, and Organization Department (Research Group Data Analytics) at Ghent University. Besides that, I am also Visiting Professor at the University of Namur. Prior to joining Ghent University, I worked as an assistant professor at the University of Edinburgh Business School and postdoctoral researcher at the KU Leuven. I studied Business Engineering and received a PhD in Business Economics at Ghent University in 2018. I have taught a wide range of data analytics courses ranging from basic statistics and database management to advanced predictive analytics and social media and web analytics. My research focuses on applications of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics in social media and customer relationship management. My research has been published in several well-known international journals such as the *European Journal of Operational Research*, *Omega*, *Decision Sciences*, among others.

### General overview

My area of research lies at the interface of *IT (databases)*, *algorithms (machine learning, AI, optimization, and econometrics models)* and *business applications*. Hence, my research focusses on applying descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics to business-related problems. I believe that the main goal of data analytics should be to use data to gain insight and eventually increase business performance. 

My **methodological** interests include:
* Big data
* Predictive modeling
* Ensemble learning 
* Text mining
* Natural Language processing
* Recommender systems
* Deep learning
* Reinforcement learning.

My **theoretical** interests include, but are not limited to: 
* Social media
* CRM (acquisition, churn and retention management, cross-selling)
* Hospitality (e.g., reviews)
* Finance
* Sports

## Research group ðŸ“ˆ

I work at the Research Group Data Analytics at the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration of Ghent University.The research group Data Analytics engages in teaching and 
research on the use of data to improve and optimize business processes. This research is based on techniques such as statistics, datamining and machine learning (e.g. deep 
learning and reinforcement learning) and big data. The research group focuses on methodological as well as technical innovations and applications in a large number of application areas. 

Below you can see a picture of the members in our research group. Currently, there are 3 professors: Prof. Dr. Dries Benoit (at the back, far left), Prof. Dr. Dirk Van den Poel (at the back, far right), and yours truly (at the back, second from left).
